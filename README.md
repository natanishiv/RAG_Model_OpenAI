# RAG Model Chatbot

## Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning a Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for an AI chatbot. The RAG model combines a retriever component for information retrieval and a generator component for response generation, resulting in more contextually relevant and accurate responses.

## Features

- Implementation of the RAG model architecture for AI chatbot functionality.
- Integration with Pinecone for efficient semantic search and retrieval of information.
- Utilization of the OpenAI API for text generation and response augmentation.
